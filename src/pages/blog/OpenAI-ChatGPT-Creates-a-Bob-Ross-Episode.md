# AI Writing a Bob Ross Episode in 2022

Back in 2018 Keaton Patti ([@KeatonPatti](https://twitter.com/keatonpatti/status/1006961202998726665)) asked AI to watch over 1000 hours of Bob Ross and write a Bob Ross video of it's own. The results were hilarious, to say the least.

This week, OpenAI released it's newest AI tool, [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), and I thought it was only fitting to ask it to write us a Bob Ross episode of its own. Here's how it did...

INT. BOB ROSS' STUDIO - DAY

We see BOB ROSS standing in front of an easel, holding a palette and brushes. He looks into the camera and smiles.

BOB ROSS:
Hello and welcome to another episode of The Joy of Painting. Today, we're going to create a beautiful autumn landscape, full of happy little trees. So grab your brushes and let's get started.

Bob begins to paint, using a thin brush to sketch out the basic shape of the landscape. He then mixes yellow and red to create a warm, orange hue, which he uses to paint the trees.

As he continues to paint, he adds more layers of color, blending them together to create a sense of depth and dimension. He uses a small brush to add in the details, such as the leaves on the trees and the grass in the foreground.

BOB ROSS:
Painting is such a therapeutic and soulful activity. It allows us to tap into our creativity and imagination, and to escape from the stresses of everyday life.

Bob adds a layer of blue to the sky, creating a sense of depth and distance. He then uses a fan brush to add in the clouds, making them appear to be gently drifting across the sky.

BOB ROSS:
When we paint, we can let go of our troubles and melt them away, just like these happy little trees. We can create a world of beauty and tranquility, right here on our canvas.

Bob adds the finishing touches to his painting, using a palette knife to add texture and depth to the trees and grass. He then signs his name in the corner, completing the beautiful autumn landscape.

BOB ROSS:
I hope you enjoyed this episode of The Joy of Painting. Until next time, happy painting and remember, there's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.

Pretty damn good and this isn't even half as cool as some of the stuff I've been asking it to do today. This new tool form OpenAI is simply incredible. In a single day I've asked it how to give good advice to a friend, had it solve a programming problem that I was stuck on, and even asked it to give me feedback on my research report. All of which it did with incredible accuracy.

If you told me last week, that I'd be playing with a tool that would replace Google search this week, I would have laughed at you. But at some point, today, it hit me. THIS tool could do it. It's that good. I tried Googling the worth of Google Search, by the way - it didn't have an answer. ChatGPT refused to speculate. But GitHub Copilot says that Google Search is worth $1.2 trillion USD. So there you go.
